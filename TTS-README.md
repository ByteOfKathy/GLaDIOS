# GLaDOS Text-to-speech (TTS) Voice Generator
Neural network based TTS Engine.

If you want to just play around with the TTS, this works as stand-alone.
```console
python3 glados-tts/glados.py
```

the TTS Engine can also be used remotely on a machine more powerful then the Pi to process in house TTS: (executed from glados-tts directory
```console
python3 engine-remote.py
```

Default port is 8124
Be sure to update settings.env variable in your main Glados-voice-assistant directory:
```
TTS_ENGINE_API			= http://192.168.1.3:8124/synthesize/
```


## Description
The initial, regular Tacotron model was trained first on LJSpeech, and then on a heavily modified version of the Ellen McClain dataset (all non-Portal 2 voice lines removed, punctuation added).

* The Forward Tacotron model was only trained on about 600 voice lines.
* The HiFiGAN model was generated through transfer learning from the sample.
* All models have been optimized and quantized.
